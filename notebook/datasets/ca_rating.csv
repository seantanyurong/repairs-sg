5,"Great team of men made up of Omar, Hossain and Nicholas. Contacted them on Friday afternoon and thankfully they had a slot for me the next day. Needed them to replace 19 light switches in the house and they were done in slightly over 1.5hrs. Team was efficient, polite and friendly. Quality of work was also meticulous. They made sure everything was in good order before they left. I highly recommend them to anyone. :)"
5,"I was very pleased with the service provided. Amos has been very helpful through the phone. I had 3 sockets and 2 LED lights replaced in my kitchen and 2 LED ceiling lights installed in my bathroom. I called other companies and they told me they only available to come 3 days later, while this company came to help me within 30mins, even though they are located in Ubi. Excellent service. I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for trustworthy and professional electricians to fix your electrical problems."
5,"Offers a very prompt and comprehensive set of services, including supply and installation of door lock sets, shower mixer tap, and LED ceiling lights. Very honest and proposed cost saving measures that other companies I checked didn't. Did not charge me additional transport cost even though they had to go out and source for another round of supplies to fit the settings of an older unit. Provided great after service, documenting all the services provided and gave a detailed accurate invoice. Would reach out again for future services."

Ask them when will they be ready, was told dont know. Frustrated and anxious I called Repair sg. Paul arranged for Daryl and Kai to my place the next day! Daryl is a gem, it doesnt take him long to diagnose all my electrical problems which have been stressing me out for days. I have a few other small jobs that Daryl and Kai were kind enough to help get it done too. Paul arranged for Amos and Rasal to come by the following week to fix my ELR that has been causing the power trip. They were delayed by the job before but Amos was professional enough to call and inform me which was really nice. They came get the work done quickly and neatly. Tested my power and explain what happen and showed me the part that was faulty! I swear Daryl didnt even open up to know that it was faulty but he was able to diagnose the problem accurately wow. Seriously if u are looking for good service honest specialist electricians look no further. These are the boys to call. I dont hope to have the same prob in the near future but I am definitely joining their fan club! Kudos!"

5,Very responsive and helpful. Helped to solve the electricity problem on the phone by giving some instructions. Thank you!
5,Prompt and friendly service. Solved the issue quickly and effectively. Upfront with costs.
5,"Really thankful for the help Repair.sg provided! :) I am currently working at a children's charity Glyph Community, where we run non-academic enrichment classes for our beneficiaries. On Wednesday 8 June, the door switch of our centre door was spoilt, and thus, we could not open our centre. We had to turn away our beneficiaries as we were not able to enter the premises, and they were very disappointed that they could not participate in our holiday programmes. We reached out to as many electricians as we could, and Amos from Repair.sg came to our rescue. They were able to send down their technicians within an hour, and upon hearing about the work we do in our charity, they also kindly waived off the fees incurred. They sent Rasel, Nicholas and Omar down to our centre, and they were very efficient in replacing our switch for us. Our kids were very happy to be able to return to the centre for our holiday programmes the next day. We are really thankful for the service provided, as well as the generosity extended to us. We are really thankful for their support, it is their kindness and generosity extended to us, that keeps us and the community that we serve, going :D"

5,The workmanship provided was very professional and communication was always prompt and courteous. Will recommend Repair.sg to anyone looking for an electrician. 5 stars!
5,First time called such a well-spoken and well-mannered electrician. Would have engaged his services if not for the cost.
5,"Quick response, technician sent knew what he was doing immediately and was efficient and quick in fixing the problem."
5,There was a short circuit in my house and I couldn't switch on the internal circuit breaker. The serviceman was very helpful and advised me to check out the external circuit breaker first before consulting their help for repairs (if I really need it). Honest and helpful serviceman. Recommended :)

5,The team is very helpful and friendly during the installation. Also share the general electrical related information with me.
5,"Had a power trip and couldnt figure out the issue and needed an electrician. Call them cause close to my place. The person I spoke to said they were closed but asked me a few questions to see if he can help me troubleshoot. Fixed the issue and also educated me. It was a 5mins conversation and thank you so much for your help. If I need electrician in the near future I will sure call your company to assist. Thank you for your time, compassion and professionalism."
5,"Happened to have engaged them twice so far. The first time for checking on and reinstalling a new toilet ventilation fan, as well as replacing a lighting. In retrospect, was pleasantly surprised by the quick response (including a quick diagnose/assessment). Amos and Rasel who came to work on it were also professional and friendly, and were open with my further queries. Just recently engaged them again to replace another 2 ceiling/hanging lamps at another place. This was also on pretty short notice and the contact person was again also pretty responsive (to be honest, had forgotten about them when i was googling to engage someone; also realised their pricing felt more reasonable than the initial company i checked with which also required a 2 week wait, upon their quotation). Also had them check/advise on some random loose wiring jutting out left behind from previous owner (which they said can help and no obligations). Amos and Rasel were also the ones who came this time. Believe they kept their cool and were reassuring, even though condo mgmt gave them a difficult time when they were coming in. Again they finished up quite quickly once they've properly assessed and confirmed on the positioning/adjustments. Also made it a point to make sure the exteriors were done up as well. They also helped to properly and safely isolate the loose wiring/connection, and they priced quite fairly on the spot. Pretty fast and fust-free once again. Payment was also easy with the PayNow option. Would def recommend them."
5,"My first time engaging their services. Communication was done through whatsapp. I shared my issue with Mark, the Operations Assistant. He was swift in answering my queries and provided his solutions/recommendations. I engaged their service to change 4 of my lights to LED. The work was done within 30 mins by two of their workers. Minimal mess. Payment also can be done digitally. With their efficiency and professionalism, I'm positive that I would call on their services again if there is a need in future!"
5,"Mark was really nice and helpful when i had a power trip while testing RCCB. As he couldn't arrange for someone to come over on the same day, he messaged with info on how i can try and recover it on my own. Really appreciate!! Thanks!"
5,"Service is good. Enquired via WhatsApp and response was prompt and polite, quotation was reasonable. A team of three came for the installation. Though young, they are professional, experienced and efficient. Happy with the service and the result!"
5,"Had a faulty lighting and contacted them via WhatsApp to see if they could rectify the issue. Mark was very responsive and patiently resolved my queries. Finally, they arranged a timing the very next day to replace the faulty lighting with a new LED light. The crew were very professional and quick to finish the installation. Overall very satisfied with the service."
5,On time and friendly service from the boss and the team
5,I am delighted with their prompt and courteous service and able to secure their technicians to fix water heater switch on the same day that I called. Quotation was given very quickly and my water heater was fixed.
5,I found repair sg on google ad. Amazing fast response from them. Contacted 2 others & got no response at all. Appt was fixed on the same day. Quotation was reasonable. Change & repair was done fast. Thanks to team Amos & Rasel. Both of them are polite & efficient.
5,Referred by IKEA. Service was very on time. The handyman are very friendly and helpful. Helped me clean the ceiling too per my request:)
5,"This review is written a few minutes after I called their hotline. Paul picked up the call and apologised that the staff were already engaged. What was touching was that he didn't end the call but instead continued to ask me what the problem was, diagnosed it and even guided me to try to fix it. And it worked. My power is back. Paul was happy for me and didn't ask for any charges. I am so moved and impressed with their professionalism and generosity, they are good people."
5,"I had a lighting issue, found their contact online, got a quotation after talking through the problem and a solution within minutes. Their onsite technicians are courteous and focused on the task at hand, could not ask for more. Payment and invoicing also a breeze."
5,"Found the service on Google Maps, and liked the domain name and reviews. Kai was very polite and responsive. He and colleague Darrell carefully replaced my kitchen counter T5 lighting tubes and explained to me what had gone wrong (transformer malfunction tripping the circuit). Reasonable quote included parts and a six-month warranty. There may be cheaper electricians out there but this one hopefully delivers peace of mind.u"
5,"Engaged their service as there was power trip at the kitchen area , they detected the issue and provided the solution to fix the issue, go extra mile to think of what can be done better for the wiring as well. Kudos to the team !"
5,"This is my second time seeking Repair.sg assistance for faulty lights & sockets. The team of Amos, Rasel & Nicholas arrived on time, and after understanding the issues, promptly got down to work and completed all repairs within 30-minutes. Rasel was particularly handy and meticulous with his works. I truly appreciate the team efforts to help me resolve the issues promptly and professionally. Thank you."
5,First time using this company and needed to change a 20A switch for oven. Communication was on WhatsApp and quite responsive even on a weekend. Special request to procure the same switch design was delightfully addressed. Appointment booking was swift and punctual. Job was done professionally. Will use them again.
5,I was looking for electrician to replace/install 3 LED Ceiling lights at my Kitchen and Study Room and I was delighted with Repair.sg service. Amos and Rasel who attended the installation were polite & professional and they were fast!- work was completed in about 15mins These guys even cleaned up the area after the installation and assisted with the disposal of the old lights. I would engage their services again in a heartbeat .The pricing was the most reasonable of the 3 quotes I received prior . Thank you Repair.sg
5,had issues with the electrical db box and went google to search for electricians. contacted daylight as ratings is highest among all. they replied that they currently do not have any electricians in sg who do power trips at the moment and i was quite disappointed. went for the 2nd highest in rating which is repair.sg and i was totally impressed with their service and professionalism. Amos was the one who liaise with me via phone/messages and was very responsive and accommodating throughout. Kai was the one who came by for the installation and displayed professionalism and also helped to answer all my queries. i am happy to have found them and they shall be my go-to-electricians for any future jobs. well done guys!
5,First time using this company. Communication done using WhatsApp. Sent pictures of electrical issue. Reply was fast. Electrician was well dressed and arrived on time. He spoke English well. His work was professional. He went beyond the issue by doing preventive maintenance by checking and tightening a screw behind that was coming loose. All repairs done fast and no mess left behind. Very happy to recommend them to family and friends.
